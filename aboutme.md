Hi! I'm JimAmp, or James in real life. I enjoy playing games, streaming, and generally geeking out with technology. By day, I work for Microsoft and you can find out more about my ["real life" elsewhere](https://jamesbmarshall.com). Here, I'm the unlikely gaming Dad who's just here for a laugh and to make some friends along the way.

I've been playing computer games since I was a kid, but I've never really been any good at them. In fact, I think I've only ever completed one in my life (so far, at least): Metroid 2. Some time in 2020 I decided to start streaming, originally on Mixer and now on Twitch. I'm not doing it to become famous or rich, but because I enjoy meeting new people, having fun, and knowing that people might be watching forces me to actually play games "properly"! That said, I wouldn't say no to becoming rich and famous! 👀

I also enjoy the 'art' of streaming - learning about sound, lighting, streaming technology, etc. I'd taken theatre studies when I was in school and always liked the technical side of things, so streaming on Twitch allows me to explore that further. I might not be the best gamer, but I want my stream to be the best quality it can so you can at least watch me be average in high definition!

Anyway, thanks for stopping by and maybe I'll see you in the chat on my [stream](https://twitch.tv/JimAmp), or on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYPy026hEqSmwsix1WfgidA)!
